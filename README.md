#Introduction
Game Rules:
Eating Pellets: The main objective is to eat all the pellets in the maze. These small dots are scattered throughout the board and must be consumed to progress.
Avoiding Ghosts: Colorful ghosts will be chasing Pacman throughout the maze. If a ghost catches Pacman, a life is lost.

Power Pellets: Special power pellets are placed in the maze's corners. When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue and become vulnerable, allowing Pacman to eat them for extra points.

Extra Lives: Players start with a set number of lives. If a life is lost, players can continue playing until all their lives are exhausted.

Advancing Levels: After clearing all the pellets in a maze, players advance to the next level where the game becomes more challenging with faster ghosts and new mazes.

Scoring Points: Points are earned by eating pellets, power pellets, and ghosts. The more you eat and the faster you clear a level, the higher your score will be.

High Score: Players can challenge themselves to achieve the highest score possible and aim to beat it in each playthrough.
